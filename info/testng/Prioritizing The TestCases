In TestNG, you can prioritize test cases by using the priority attribute in the @Test annotation.
TestNG executes test methods based on their assigned priority value. The lower the priority number, the earlier the test will run.
Test cases without a priority are given a default priority of 0, and they will be executed after the prioritized test cases (unless explicitly assigned a priority).

[If two or more test methods have the same priority, they will be executed in the order they appear in the class.]
[Test cases without a priority attribute will be treated as having a default priority of 0.]


import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class TestPriorityExample {

    @Test(priority = 1)
    public void loginTest() {
        System.out.println("Login test executed");
    }

    @Test(priority = 2)
    public void searchTest() {
        System.out.println("Search test executed");
    }

    @Test(priority = 3)
    public void addToCartTest() {
        System.out.println("Add to Cart test executed");
    }

    @Test(priority = 4)
    public void checkoutTest() {
        System.out.println("Checkout test executed");
    }
}
