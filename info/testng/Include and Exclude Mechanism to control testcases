 the include and exclude mechanisms allow you to control which test methods are executed

 This is useful when you want to selectively run or skip certain tests in a suite or class.
In the TestNG XML file, you can specify which methods to include or exclude in a <methods> block under a <class> element.

XML Structure:
<include>: Specifies which test methods should be run.
<exclude>: Specifies which test methods should be skipped.
