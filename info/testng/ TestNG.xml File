TestNG.xml file is a configuration file that helps in organizing our tests.
It makes a tester’s job easier by controlling the execution of tests by putting all the test cases together and run it under one XML file.

Running a TestNG. xml File.


Hierarchy of the XML File
Here’s the hierarchy or structure (anarchy) of the XML file:

suite
    test
        classes
            class (name="Section16TestNG.testNG")
            class (name="Section16TestNG.anotherTestNGclass")

Hierarchical Breakdown:
At the top level, you have the <suite> element.
Inside the <suite> element, there’s a <test> element, which represents one test set.
Inside the <test> element, there is a <classes> element, which holds a list of <class> elements.
Each <class> element specifies a test class that TestNG will execute.


Major advantages of TestNG.xml file are:

It provides parallel execution of test methods.
It allows the dependency of one test method on another test method.
It helps in prioritizing our test methods.
It allows grouping of test methods into test groups.
It supports the parameterization of test cases using @Parameters annotation.
It helps in Data-driven testing using @DataProvider annotation.
It has different types of assertions that help in validating the expected results with the actual results.
It has different types of HTML reports, Extent reports, etc. for a better and clear understanding of our test summary.
It has listeners who help in creating logs.
