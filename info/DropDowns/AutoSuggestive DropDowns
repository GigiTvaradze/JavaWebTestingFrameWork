Auto-suggestive dropdowns (or auto-complete dropdowns) are more advanced than static and dynamic dropdowns.
They typically involve a text input field that provides suggestions as you type, based on a list of options that might be fetched dynamically from a server.

<input type="text" id="autoSuggestInput" placeholder="Type to search">
<div id="suggestions" class="suggestions">
    <div class="suggestion-item">Option 1</div>
    <div class="suggestion-item">Option 2</div>
    <div class="suggestion-item">Option 3</div>
</div>

Auto-suggestive dropdowns are usually implemented with an <input> field where suggestions appear in a dropdown list.

// Locate the input field and type a value to trigger the auto-suggest feature
WebElement inputField = driver.findElement(By.id("autoSuggestInput"));
inputField.sendKeys("Option"); // Type a value to trigger suggestions


Wait for Suggestions to Appear (Suggestions might take a moment to appear, so you should use explicit waits to ensure they are visible before interacting with them):

bDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
WebElement suggestionsList = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("suggestions")));

// Locate and click the desired suggestion
WebElement suggestion = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@id='suggestions']/div[text()='Option 2']"));
suggestion.click();

// Verify the selected value in the input field
String selectedValue = inputField.getAttribute("value");
System.out.println("Selected value: " + selectedValue);


Handle Special Cases:

Handling Delays and Loading States: Some auto-suggestive dropdowns might load suggestions dynamically. Ensure you handle delays and loading states using explicit waits.

Dealing with Multiple Suggestions: If there are multiple suggestions, ensure you have a clear strategy to select the desired one, especially if they are not unique.
