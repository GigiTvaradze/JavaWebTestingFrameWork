Validating whether UI elements (like buttons, input fields, checkboxes, etc.) are enabled or disabled is an essential part of UI testing.
You can do this by checking the element's attributes or using Selenium WebDriver's built-in methods.

Selenium provides a straightforward method called isEnabled() to check if a UI element is enabled.
This method returns true if the element is enabled and false if it is disabled.

approach :
isEnabled() Method: Use this to directly check if an element is enabled. It's the most straightforward approach.
Attribute Checks: For elements disabled by attributes like disabled, readonly, or custom attributes, you can inspect these attributes to determine the element's state.
Custom Attributes: If your application uses custom logic to disable elements, check those attributes accordingly.

P.S: Selenium WebDriverâ€™s isEnabled() Method is not working as expected

For me Attribute Check is optimal approach .getAttribute("class")
                                                     .contains("r-14lw9ot")){
